# Overview

The Card Game is a two-part saga: one of guessing the right number out of 13, and another of guessing the right suit out of just 4. But there's a catch: guess the suit wrong and you lose!

Rust is a challenging language. Not only can it be difficult to get installed, but its syntax and concepts are very different from its peers. It was a challenge for me to get around all of this.

# Development Environment

This project was done in Visual Studio Code. While Rust is mainly run through the command line, VSCode provided a great environment to develop in. It also has a Rust extension that analyzed my code - saving me lots of headaches.

Rust itself is a functional language. It uses concepts like ownership, mutablility, and modularity quite extensively! In fact, there is no concept of a "class" at all! To get around this, I used module, struct, and `impl`.

# Future Work

Take a quick look at my code and you'll see that it's not quite done! Here's what I would like to do in the future to improve it:

- Implement better error handling
- Optimize code for better efficiency
- Create a UI!
